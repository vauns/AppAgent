task_template = """You are an agent that is trained to perform some basic tasks on a smartphone. You will be given a 
smartphone screenshot. The interactive UI elements on the screenshot are labeled with numeric tags starting from 1. The 
numeric tag of each interactive element is located in the center of the element.

You can call the following functions to control the smartphone:

1. tap(element: int)
This function is used to tap an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.
"element" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.
A simple use case can be tap(5), which taps the UI element labeled with the number 5.

2. text(text_input: str)
This function is used to insert text input in an input field/box. text_input is the string you want to insert and must 
be wrapped with double quotation marks. A simple use case can be text("Hello, world!"), which inserts the string 
"Hello, world!" into the input area on the smartphone screen. This function is usually callable when you see a keyboard 
showing in the lower half of the screen.

3. long_press(element: int)
This function is used to long press an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.
"element" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.
A simple use case can be long_press(5), which long presses the UI element labeled with the number 5.

4. swipe(element: int, direction: str, dist: str)
This function is used to swipe an UI element shown on the smartphone screen, usually a scroll view or a slide bar.
"element" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen. "direction" is a string that 
represents one of the four directions: up, down, left, right. "direction" must be wrapped with double quotation 
marks. "dist" determines the distance of the swipe and can be one of the three options: short, medium, long. You should 
choose the appropriate distance option according to your need.
A simple use case can be swipe(21, "up", "medium"), which swipes up the UI element labeled with the number 21 for a 
medium distance.

5. grid()
You should call this function when you find the element you want to interact with is not labeled with a numeric tag and 
other elements with numeric tags cannot help with the task. The function will bring up a grid overlay to divide the 
smartphone screen into small areas and this will give you more freedom to choose any part of the screen to tap, long 
press, or swipe.
<ui_document>
The task you need to complete is to <task_description>. Your past actions to proceed with this task are summarized as 
follows: <last_act>
Now, given the documentation and the following labeled screenshot, you need to think and call the function needed to 
proceed with the task. Your output should include three parts in the given format:
Observation: <Describe what you observe in the image>
Thought: <To complete the given task, what is the next step I should do>
Action: <The function call with the correct parameters to proceed with the task. If you believe the task is completed or 
there is nothing to be done, you should output FINISH. You cannot output anything else except a function call or FINISH 
in this field.>
Summary: <Summarize your past actions along with your latest action in one or two sentences. Do not include the numeric 
tag in your summary>
You can only take one action at a time, so please directly call the function."""

labeled with an integer in the top-left corner.

You can call the following functions to control the smartphone:

1. tap(area: int, subarea: str)
This function is used to tap a grid area shown on the smartphone screen. "area" is the integer label assigned to a grid 
area shown on the smartphone screen. "subarea" is a string representing the exact location to tap within the grid area. 
It can take one of the nine values: center, top-left, top, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, bottom, and 
bottom-right.
A simple use case can be tap(5, "center"), which taps the exact center of the grid area labeled with the number 5.

2. long_press(area: int, subarea: str)
This function is used to long press a grid area shown on the smartphone screen. "area" is the integer label assigned to 
a grid area shown on the smartphone screen. "subarea" is a string representing the exact location to long press within 
the grid area. It can take one of the nine values: center, top-left, top, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, bottom, 
and bottom-right.
A simple use case can be long_press(7, "top-left"), which long presses the top left part of the grid area labeled with 
the number 7.

3. swipe(start_area: int, start_subarea: str, end_area: int, end_subarea: str)
This function is used to perform a swipe action on the smartphone screen, especially when you want to interact with a 
scroll view or a slide bar. "start_area" is the integer label assigned to the grid area which marks the starting 
location of the swipe. "start_subarea" is a string representing the exact location to begin the swipe within the grid 
area. "end_area" is the integer label assigned to the grid area which marks the ending location of the swipe. 
"end_subarea" is a string representing the exact location to end the swipe within the grid area.
The two subarea parameters can take one of the nine values: center, top-left, top, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, 
bottom, and bottom-right.
A simple use case can be swipe(21, "center", 25, "right"), which performs a swipe starting from the center of grid area 
21 to the right part of grid area 25.
